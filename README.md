# Utilizes the psi4numpy helper_CI machinery to do QED-CI up to QED-FCI.

- helper_cqed_rhf.py provides restricted hartree fock for the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the coherent state basis
- helper_ciss_prism.py provides spin-adapted QED-CIS for Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the coherent state basis
- helper_PFCI.py provides helper functions for arbitrary CI with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the coherent state basis
